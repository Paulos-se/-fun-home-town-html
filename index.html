    <p>Asmera, is the capital and most populous city of Eritrea, in the country's Central Region. It sits at an elevation of
    2,325 metres (7,628 ft), making it the sixth highest capital in the world by altitude. The city is located at the tip of
    an escarpment that is both the northwestern edge of the Eritrean Highlands and the Great Rift Valley in neighbouring
    Ethiopia. In 2017, the city was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its well-preserved modernist
    architecture.[3][4] The site of Asmera was first settled in 800 BC with a population ranging from 100 to 1,000. The city
    was then founded in the 12th century AD after four separate villages unified to live together peacefully after long
    periods of conflict.</p>
